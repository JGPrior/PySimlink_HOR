# PySimlink

**PySimlink** is a python package that automatically compiles Simulink codegen files 
into a simple interface that you can interact with in Python!

With this package, you can:
- Interact with the internals of your Simulink model
- run the model in "accelerator mode"
- send and receive data in the form of numpy arrays

All without requiring a MATLAB runtime! All you need is Simulink Coder, and the ability to export your model to
a grt target.
