# PySimlink

**PySimlink** is a python package that automatically compiles Simulink codegen files 
into a simple interface that you can interact with in Python!

With this package, you can:
- Interact with the internals of your Simulink model
- Run the model in "accelerator mode"
- Send and receive data in the form of numpy arrays

All without requiring a MATLAB runtime on the target machine! 

To get started, you need is Simulink Coder, and the ability to export your model to a grt 
target. There are some limitations, namely that your model *must* use a fixed step solver 
(a requirement of the grt target).

What this is not:
- A replacement to the [Simulink Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink-coder.html). 
  - This does not generate code for a Simulink mode. You still need the Simulink Coder. 
- A replacement for the [MATLAB Engine For Python](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html)
  - This does not interact with MATLAB in any way. It only interacts with your generated model
- A repository containing _any_ Mathworks library header files.
  - Distributing library header files from any Mathworks program or its content is a violation
    of your license agreement, with an exception for code generated by Simulink Coder. 
  - See your license agreement(sec. 3.1) for more details.
